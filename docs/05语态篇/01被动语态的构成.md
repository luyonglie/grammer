##   3.被动语态与系表结构  

>   此处的系表结构是指“连系动词+用作表语的动词-ed形式”，它与被动语态的形式完全一 样，应注意二者的区别。  

###   (1)被动语态中的过去分词是动词，多强调动作；系表结构中的过去分词相当于形容词，多强调状态。

> 前者通常可用by+人/抽象名词，表示动作的执行者，而后者则一般不用。

  The gate to the garden was locked by the  girl.  

  通向花园的门被那个女孩锁上了。(被动结构)  

  The gate to the garden was locked.  

  通向花园的门锁了。     (系表结构)  

  The tree was blown down by the high winds.  

  那棵树被大风吹倒了。     (被动结构)  

  The tree was blown down when we saw it.  

  我们看到那棵树时，它已经被吹倒了。(系表结构)  

>   **注 少数“连系动词be+用作表语的动词-ed形式”也带by短语。**

  例如：  

The oldman was surrounded by small children. 

老人被孩子们团团围住。     (被动语态)

  The tree is known by its fruit.  

看到果子就知道是什么树。(系表结构)  

 

###   (2) 系表结构中的过去分词可被very、too、so修饰， 被动语态中的过去分词须用much修饰。 



 The boy was too frightened to move.  

  这个男孩子吓得动也不敢动。   (系表结构)  

 He was very excited   

  他很激动。(系表结构)  

  He was much excited by the news.

###   (3)系表结构一般只用于一般现在时、一般过去时等少数几种时态；而被动语态则可用于多种时态。

  这篇作文写得很好。     (系表结构)  

  The composition is being written.

###   (4) 表示“充满”的“be+过去分词+with”结构多为系表结构。
